Flask-Mux's documentation!
=====================================
**Flask-Mux** is a lightweight Flask extension that provides a routing 
system similar to that of Express.js_. It basically wraps Flask's 
url route registrations API to add more flexibility.

Get started with Installation_ and then get an overview with 
the :doc:`quickstart`. There is also a more detailed :doc:`example/flask-mux` 
that shows how to create a small but complete application with Flask. 
The rest of the docs describe each component of Flask in detail, 
with a full reference in the :doc:`flask_mux` section.
